🚀 TASKFLOW – Secure Task Management System

TASKFLOW is a full-stack MERN application designed to manage tasks securely and efficiently.
It demonstrates authentication, protected routing, scalable backend architecture, and a modern responsive UI.

The system allows authenticated users to manage their tasks while maintaining strong security practices and clean project structure for scalability.
